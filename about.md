### Who Are You and Why Do You Have a Blog?

I'm an independent full-stack web contractor.

This blog is mostly a record-keeping project. It's a place to document what I've
learned and what I've worked on; a portfolio of sorts.

### Wouldn't a journal accomplish the same thing?

Making this public forces me to organize my thoughts in a way that allows them
to be easily explained to other people. A journal is mostly a collection of day
to day thoughts with no coherent message, while a blog forces a narrative.
