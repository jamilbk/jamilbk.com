# Humble Home


In the spring of 2014 I began to experience a strange feeling of wanting to do
something different with my day to day time. I had been a Rails contractor
working remotely for 2 years straight with not much of a vacation, and
I fantasized about traveling, seeing the open road, surrounding myself in
nature to buckle down on a project or series of books. In general, an escape
from the daily grind.

Some would call it burnout; I thought it was my Saturn Return. I just felt like
embarking on a big project and completing it for once. The past 3 years had
been filled with half-finished and half-assed side projects, and if there's one
thing I knew could keep my attention for more than a few weeks, it was
a physical building project. So I essentially made a spur of the moment
decision to sublet my apartment in SF, drive back to Texas (to my great fortune
my folks have a few acres there where I decided I would build), and quit my job
to build a tinyhouse.

Now, this all seems like a crazy idea. But at the time, it felt natural,
exciting, and ambitious... yet very achievable. Thinking back, I probably drew
most of the inspiration from this Techcrunch article. A custom-made wooden
abode, with room for a comfy computer desk, queen bed and everything a man
needs? Plus, my studio in SF was 400 sq ft, and this home, at around 200,
didn't seem much smaller. Factor in the $300 rent and I was sold.

When most people think tinyhouse they think "cute", "offgrid", "eco-friendly",
and "free".
