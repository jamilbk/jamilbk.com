From the summer of 2014 to the spring of 2016, I took a sabbatical to design
and build my own tiny house.

## Why I Built a Tiny House

In the spring of 2014 I began to experience a strange feeling of wanting to do
something different with my day to day time. I had been a Rails contractor
working remotely for 2 years straight with not much of a vacation, and
I fantasized about traveling, seeing the open road, surrounding myself in
nature to buckle down on a project or series of books. In general, an escape
from the daily grind.

Some would call it burnout; I thought it was my Saturn Return. I just felt like
embarking on a big project and completing it for once. The past 3 years had
been filled with half-finished and half-assed side projects, and if there's one
thing I knew could keep my attention for more than a few weeks, it was
a physical building project. So I essentially made a spur of the moment
decision to sublet my apartment in SF, drive back to Texas (to my great fortune
my folks have a few acres there where I decided I would build), and quit my job
to build a tiny house.

Now, this all seems like a crazy idea. But at the time, it felt natural,
exciting, and ambitious... yet very achievable. Thinking back, I probably drew
most of the inspiration from this Techcrunch article. A custom-made wooden
abode, with room for a comfy computer desk, queen bed and everything a man
needs? Plus, my studio in SF was 400 sq ft, and this home, at around 200,
didn't seem much smaller. Factor in the $300 rent and I was sold.

When most people think tinyhouse they think "cute", "offgrid", "eco-friendly",
and "free". Tinyhouse living is almost the opposite of that. Most
municipalities prohibit RV living on private property (yes even your own) for
extended periods of time, and because tinyhouses aren't exactly "under the
radar" like a stealth van, neighbors or will call and complain or pesky
inspectors will come knocking.

I've had 5 different addresses in 3 years of living in the Bay Area, always
seeking the most comfortable yet cost-effective living situation. Somewhere
along the way, I got sick of paying increasing rent for living where I wanted.
I got sick of scheduling my major vacations and life transitions in 3, 6, or
12-month increments. I also became disheartened by the cost of owning a home --
not just the price of the home, but the time and energy required shopping for
it, maintaining utilities, mortgages, the yard, building code, HOA code, and
property tax. It just seems so high maintenance.

There are times when I feel overwhelmed by concrete, people, the monotony and
predictability of the daily city routine. When this happens, I like to take
a mini sabbatical to reconnect myself to the humanity of a fresh experience.
Most of the time this means going solo camping or taking a mini road trip.
A well-designed tiny house is the perfect vehicle for this. No need to pack.

I look at the material things around me and wonder if I could design
a lifestyle that didn't place so much importance on owning those things. When
I moved to San Francisco, I owned only what could fit in a car. Without
a couch, TV, and cooking supplies, I went out most nights to eat and explore,
and making friends happened organically. When I invited those friends over for
dinner, I resisted buying a kitchen table. Instead, people sat in a circle on
floor pillows. I think it made for a much more intimate dining experience.
I sit in chairs enough anyway.

I work remotely as an independent developer. I get tired of going to coffee
shops and co-working spaces to work. They're neither collaborative nor
focus-friendly, but somewhere in between, where I can work alone and not feel
alone. But after a while, I realized this isn't the solution. I'd rather work
in either long stretches of pristine solitude, or in highly engaged sessions
face-to-face. For the former, what could be more ideal than an office at the
beach, in the forest, or on a snow-covered mountain?

## The Build

<a name='design-goals'></a>
### Design Goals

As with any large project, the first phase consisted of vast amounts of
research. This means basically sitting on the couch browsing Pinterest, tiny
house forums, various subreddits, and whatever else might generate design
ideas. I had a rough idea of the design goals of my house: off-grid capable,
not too unwieldy to tow regularly, and robust -- habitable for decades to come
without major repairs to the structure.

I started with pretty much knowing nothing about building a house. I used
Sketchup and started prototyping out a rough design. It would help to have read
a book about basic modern home building first as I no clue about standard
measurements and sizes of things, like counter-top cabinets being 24" deep
while the cabinets overhead are 12". Some of this I was able to improvise along
the way (e.g. building my own kitchen counter-top, but some of it later came
back to bite me (not leaving space for 2x4s spacers inside my metal window and
door framing).

Although it's on a 16' trailer, I want my house to be practical enough to
comfortably shelter 4 adults for weekend ski trips, tiny dinner parties, and
the occasional road trip or two. I also want to be fairly independent of
grid-tied scenarios; I suspect I'll be dancing around from place to place as
I navigate the legal contours of living in a tiny house in greater San
Francisco.  As a result, my soft goal for the house is to support a decent
living without resupplies for 4 person-weeks. That means electricity,
showering, dishes, drinking water, food, and propane for 1 person for 4 weeks,
or 4 people for 1 week.

I believe one of the primary reasons folks get hassled for living full-time in
RVs is because they are, for the most part, unsightly. Airstreams are beautiful
feats of engineering, but even they don't blend in well as a full-time dwelling
in an urban or suburban environment. I was originally planning to use
a maintenance-free material for the exterior siding such as corrugated aluminum
or [Corten RustWall
panels](http://www.cortenroofing.com/rustwall-reg-panel_8_1160_30805.html), but
I've decided to stick with the standard cedar planks. The less my house stands
out, the easier it'll be to find permanent parking.

Since I make my living on my computer, I want to be able to work comfortably
anytime, anywhere. The electrical system will need to power a laptop, a few
lights, and internet equipment for up to 12 hours, in the case of a winter
all-nighter. It will also need to handle power spikes of a few hours at a time,
such as running toaster oven, lights, range fan, and A/C simultaneously.

I also want to be able to maintain a comfortable 68 - 78&#176;F whether I'm in
Austin for the summer or Colorado for the winter. Closed-cell spray foam
insulation seems to be the most practical solution here, if a bit pricey. Along
with rigid foam insulation, a radiant heat barrier, and the interior / exterior
siding, I'm looking at an insulating R-value in the mid 30's. An 8,000 BTU
window air conditioner should cool the 100 sq ft nicely.

For heating, I've seen a lot of folks go with [Dickinson
Marine](http://dickinsonmarine.com/propane.php)'s propane fireplace, but
I wanted something that provides more ambient heat as opposed to a single
point-source of toasty air. Because if your toes are cold, it doesn't matter
how warm the rest of you is -- you're still cold. So I'm planning to integrate
a closed-loop solar in-floor heating system.

I spent a couple days crunching numbers trying to size the system, but it's
difficult given the amount of thermal variables in a mobile tiny house. I plan
to use 4 solar heating panels on the roof, anti-freeze coolant,
variable-voltage DC pump, and PEX tubing snaked under the hardwood floor boards
to heat my home. I can adjust the amount of heat exchanged into the home by
dialing up or down the speed of the pump. Frigid nights will prove challenging,
however -- an insulated coolant storage tank may be necessary to collect the
day's heat. If all else fails, I can always light the oven to double as
a makeshift fireplace.

## Tiny House Life

Tiny House lifestyle has its pros and cons. It's an exciting way to live,
questioning the commonplace, minimalistic (in a literal sense), and always with
its challenges. But contrary to what popular TV shows may convey about tiny
house life, it's not always butterflies and rainbows.

<a name='towing'></a>
### Towing

Towing a tiny house is essentially like towing any other form of trailer. One
thing to keep in mind is that tiny houses are generally much heavier than an RV
of similar size due to the beefier construction materials. As long as the home
is built soundly and attached to the trailer securely, towing a tiny house
should be familiar to anyone that's towed a trailer before.

One thing you need to make extra-sure of in the case of tiny houses is that the
weight is distributed properly between the trailer axles and tongue. This is
what primarily determines towing stability at highway speeds. RVs are
manufactured to take this into account at a fundamental level, but tiny houses
are often designed without consideration for towing stability.

When it comes to towing, there are two main types of trailer designs common to
tiny houses: v-nose and goose-neck. v-nose trailers are by far the
most common. These are generally what you picture when you think of a trailer.
The trailer frame extends to converge to a "V" at the front of the trailer at
the same level of the axles, and this "V" (called the trailer nose) attaches to
a ball on the rear of the truck at bumper level. Note that nowadays (and
especially with heavier trailers) the nose does not actually attach to the
truck's bumper but instead a thick steel hitch bolted directly to the truck's
rear frame section.

The second type, goose-neck, use a hitch structure that rises from the frame of
the trailer up and over the truck's rear tailgate and attaches to a ball in the
bed of the truck. This ball is bolted to a fortified steel platform hidden
under the bed and bolted to the truck's frame. Goose-neck trailers are commonly
used for towing very heavy loads since they're much more stable at highway
speed than a similarly-weighted bumper-pull equivalent.

There are better resources online to learn about towing, so I won't go into too
much more depth here. The most important thing to remember for towing is the
weight distribution ratio of the trailer. For v-nose trailers, 15% of the
total weight of the trailer should rest on the nose and the remaining 85" on
the trailer axles. For goose-neck trailer, this number is 20%. This has to do
with the laws of physics; it ensures the trailer tracks the truck properly and
not the other way around.

When you're on the road with a tiny house, you get looks. Mostly good looks. The
first question I usually get from curious folks is, "Is that a tiny house?!", to
which I usually reply "What's a tiny house?" followed by a slight grin. I
built the house as an escape for the daily routine, the mundane, the typical.
By asking this question, I usually get them to ask themselves what really is a
tiny house (hint: there is no formal definition), and in that space of
open-mindedness where labels and notions and ideas of what tiny houses and
their lifestyles are all about, I tell them my story.
